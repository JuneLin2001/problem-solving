> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5]  
> **Output:** 8  
> **Explanation:**  
> The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.

#### Example 2:

> **Input:** nums = [5]  
> **Output:** 5  
> **Explanation:**  
> Since there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 9`
